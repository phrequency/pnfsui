Four people were taken to the hospital after a violent five-vehicle accident in Lehigh County.<br/><br/>The accident happened on Route 309 near Gun Club Road in Lynn Township Friday afternoon.<br/><br/>The crash occurred as a vehicle traveling northbound crossed over into the southbound lanes. The vehicle sideswiped an oncoming car, then spun hitting another vehicle. A separate car then rear ended that crash.</p><p>

The vehicle that was sideswiped traveled over 100 feet sideways before striking another car traveling northbound.</p><p>

Four people were taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital with minor to moderate injuries.</p><p>

Today: Intervals of clouds and sun; a stray PM shower possible, mainly north and west. High: 66</p><p>

Tonight: Partly cloudy. Low: 42</p><p>

Sunday: Breezy with clouds and sun; a shower in spots late in the day. High: 65 Low: 40</p><p>

After a soaker on Friday, the area will have a chance to dry out this weekend. Although, the weekend won't be totally rain-free. Today isolated showers are possible during the afternoon and evening, but they will mainly stay north and west of the Lehigh Valley.</p><p>

On Sunday the shower activity will again come during the afternoon and evening, but they will be more widespread than today. With that said most of the models are printing out less than a tenth of an inch of rain through this weekend, so we're not expecting a whole lot of rain and the vast majority of the weekend will be dry.</p><p>

Laura Weaver is one of the thousands of Met-Ed customers in the region. She was shocked to find out that her electric bill could increase by about 25 percent on June 1.<br/><br/>"It is kind of shocking actually because just coming out of college, I have all of my student loans and my fiance and I are just starting to get on our feet," said Laura Weaver of Pottstown.<br/><br/>Depending on your provider, you could be paying more or less. <br/><br/>The PUC says it is time for utility companies to buy power and right now that rate is at a higher price.<br/><br/>"By law, the utilities, Met-Ed, PPL, PECO, they cannot make a profit on electric generation. So they are simply going out, buying that power and passing along that cost to the customer," said information specialist Dave Hixson with the Public Utilitiy Commission.<br/><br/>Some Met-Ed customers say a 25 percent hike might be too hard to handle.<br/><br/>"It makes me worry because as a 20 something, getting on my feet is hard enough. Knowing that I am going to have to pay more for something as simple as electricity is going to be rough," said Weaver.<br/><br/>And others might consider changing providers.<br/><br/>"We have to definitely weigh our options because money is tight. The economy is still underwater," said Mark Krotee of West Reading.<br/><br/>But beware: the PUC encourages customers to be careful when switching providers, especially after numerous customers switched providers this winter and saw their electric bills soar.<br/><br/>"Make sure you are completely comfortable with all the terms and conditions before you make the switch to a supplier," said Hixson.<br/><br/>The PUC says to look at the kilowatt per hour and look to see if it is a fixed rate or variable rate. <br/><br/>A fixed rate offers some stability because the price will not fluctuate. With a variable rate, you could start paying less, but as demand goes up, so could your costs.<br/><br/>The PUC also says to be aware of any introduction prices or cancelation fees.<br/><br/>All of that information can be found at its website PAPowerSwitch.com</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:120:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26028690/medRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/15oxkmq/-/Electric-rates-to-increase-June-1.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"23664";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sat, 17 May 2014 03:23:32 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26028682";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-17T03:23:32Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1357.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_habngmhx";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"377.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"176";s:5:"width";s:3:"320";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_xp96quf3";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"475.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"272";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"480";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_wzqom9tq";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"614.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_tg82fjcm";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"822.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_pe6gyqfp";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1120.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_tmhnmepm/flavor/1_k0wp02t2";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:96:"

A man already serving time in state prison has been identified as the suspect in the killing of another man in Reading.</p><p>

Michael Lee Paris is facing charges of first and third degree murder in the deadly shooting of Steven Crespo, based on an indictment handed up by an investigating grand jury, authorities announced Friday.</p><p>

The Florida man, a former Reading resident, was gunned down in the 300 block of West Douglass Street on Oct. 19, 2012, in an apparent case of mistaken identity.</p><p>

According to court documents:</p><p>

A woman upset about her apartment being burglarized contacted Paris and told him she wanted him to do something about it. Paris allegedly told her he "was going to take care of it."</p><p>

Later in the day, police said the woman drove Crespo and the would-be victim who she suspected of burglarizing her apartment to the intersection of Schuylkill Avenue and West Douglass Street, with Paris following her to the location.</p><p>

Crespo got out of the car, and within a minute, the woman told police she heard gunshots.</p><p>

The woman left the scene and later told Paris that he got the wrong guy, said police, who added that Paris's response was, "It just got out of hand and he's dead."</p><p>

Paris, 26, is currently serving time at Graterford Prison in Montgomery County on unrelated charges in Berks County.</p><p>

In addition to the murder charges in Crespo's death, Paris is charged with criminal homicide, conspiracy, possession of a prohibited firearm, and firearms not to be carried without a license.</p><p>

A Bethlehem woman says a pit bull in her apartment building has lashed out one too many times.</p><p>

April Pilz says a child is the latest victim of the dog.</p><p>

"I've had three incidents with this dog, three separate incidents," Pilz told 69 News.</p><p>

She is a dog lover who has four dogs herself, but she said her neighbor's pit bull has been nothing but a problem since she moved into her apartment on 3rd Avenue in Bethlehem about a year and a half ago.</p><p>

"I have been afraid of their dog since I've lived here and now I'm more afraid of their dog because I know what he's capable of," she said.</p><p>

Pilz said the dog has bitten two of her dogs and her hand in their building's fenced-in yard.</p><p>

She said her Jack Russell Terrier was first bitten soon after she first moved into the building.</p><p>

"He slipped out of his collar, ran across the yard and picked up my dog by his throat and attempted to shake him," said Pilz.</p><p>

She said another one of her dogs, a whippet/pit bull mix, has been involved in two incidents with the other dog, the most serious in March.</p><p>

"Before I could get a hold of her and get her back on her leash, she had gotten within that dog's leash range and he had just grabbed her by the throat and he was attempting to shake her," said Pilz. "That's when I had to get involved because I feared for her life.</p><p>

Pilz said she tried to remove the dog from her dog and was bitten in the process.</p><p>

"My hand needed to be stitched where the deepest bite was. I then developed a serious infection that then started to travel up my arm," she said.</p><p>

Pilz is a massage therapist and said she missed about a month of work and her hand is still recovering. She filed a police report after the March incident.</p><p>

She said a ten year-old boy who lives nearby is the most recent victim and was bitten under his chin.</p><p>

"The dog came out of his apartment, to the best of my knowledge, to go for his walk on his leash with one of his owners, saw him sitting on the front steps and just grabbed him by the neck and shook him," she explained.

Captain Edison Mora with the U.S Army has been deployed in Iraq and hasn't seen his wife or two boys in nine months, but that all changed Friday afternoon.<br/><br/>The family was reunited during an assembly at Farmersville Elementary School in Bethlehem Township.<br/><br/>Captain Mora had returned from his fifth tour overseas several days ago and enlisted the help of his son's first grade teacher and the school principal to surprise his family.<br/><br/>&#8220;It all happened very fast but Captain Mora's been in touch with us and it's just one of those things that as a principal, it's once in a lifetime opportunity and to share that special moment with the family it's an honor, it truly is,&#8221; said Principal Jennifer Hilton. <br/><br/>&#8220;We found out last Friday that it was definite, that this would be the date so since last Friday we've been calling everybody, and getting everything together and coordinating between emails with Captain Mora and it all fell together within a week,&#8221; said teacher Lisa Morro. <br/><br/>Cristean Mora, 7, was standing next to his mom Yolanda and younger brother Erwin as they watched a video sent from their dad.<br/><br/>Moments later, Captain Mora walked out on stage and hugged his family.<br/><br/>&#8220;They have grown, they are taller but it's nothing like holding them,&#8221; he said. <br/><br/>&#8220;I feel happy when I saw my dad...that was my favorite part,&#8221; said Cristean.<br/><br/>Mora also spoke to students and left them with some advice: &#8220;Be respectful to your teachers, to your parents at home, be kind to your fellow students, to your friends and feel blessed that you were born in the United States, there's no other country like the U.S.&#8221;<br/><br/>Mora and his family are originally from Ecuador.

Wet and soggy, the relentless rain soaked the region Friday.  <br/><br/>People were dodging raindrops as mother nature unloaded.  <br/><br/>Small creeks and streams across the area swelled.  <br/><br/>The water moved swiftly and rose up starting to invade the streets.  <br/><br/>Flood prone places looked more like rivers than roads.<br/><br/>"It looked more like a river about an hour ago," laughed Lois Wieand Friday afternoon. <br/><br/>"It's not a street at all right now," shared Raymond Lahoud.  "It seems that we have a bit of flooding going on here."<br/><br/>The rising waters took over part of Route 309 near Cherry Road in Quakertown. Traffic driving both directions was basically reduced to one lane.  <br/><br/>But not everyone steered clear of the standing high water, a move officials and more cautious drivers say to avoid.<br/><br/>"Yeah, trying to drive through it when they don't have an elevated truck," cautioned Daryl Maguire.  "A lot of low cars get stuck in here, it comes all the way back past where we are sometimes, depending on how bad it is."<br/><br/>The flooding backed up traffic on 309, and over in Washington Township storm drains that couldn't keep up had streets shut down.  <br/><br/>Barricades went up to keep everyone safe.<br/><br/>Folks who live nearby say it's nothing new.<br/><br/>"I mean we're so used to it," Wieand says.  "We expect it."<br/><br/>"I never had a problem," added Maguire.  "It floods pretty bad here, but I've never had a problem."<br/><br/>Officials say you should never drive through standing water and don't go around barricades.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:126:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26028008/medRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/xcweg3z/-/Relentless-rain-soaks-the-Lehigh-Valley.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"27556";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sat, 17 May 2014 02:33:54 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26028004";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-17T02:33:54Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1369.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_sncism33";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"371.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"176";s:5:"width";s:3:"320";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_u4k9yqr5";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"470.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"272";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"480";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_tg9fcv4d";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"668.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_oo5akkbt";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"805.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_7exog522";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1094.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_biganppg/flavor/1_pqvj9dxx";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"

"Civilian Military Combine is the world's fastest growing athletic hybrid event. It starts in revolutionary first challenge called the pit," said CEO and race founder, Keith Gornish.<br/><br/>Several Marine recruits previewed the event at a soggy Camelback Mountain in Monroe County.<br/><br/>"It really shows people their ability to perform a functional fitness workout, then being able to physically and mentally perform an obstacle course," Gornish explained.<br/><br/>Saturday, 2,000 contestants are expected to run, jump and swim through the three to seven mile obstacle course.<br/><br/>The race is one of only six CMC events held throughout the country. Gornish says the goal is to bond civilians and military members.<br/><br/>"Opportunity for civilians, military and first responders to get together cheer each other on," he said.<br/><br/>The CMC has partnered with five different military charities including the Navy Seals and the Travis Manion Foundation, named after a Bucks County Marine who was killed in Iraq.<br/><br/>Those in the military say the race isn't about who scores the best time.<br/><br/>"All people need to take away from this is you don't need to be the first to cross the finish line. Even if you take your time I feel it will be honorable," Marine recruit Christopher Davis told us.<br/><br/>The Civilian Military Combine, proving patriotism through athleticism.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:147:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26024894/medRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/w7esrhz/-/Thousands-try-to-prove-they-re-tough-enough-at-Civilian-Mili.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"23800";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 16 May 2014 23:07:44 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26024888";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-16T23:07:44Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1418.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_90reaq5q";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"377.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"176";s:5:"width";s:3:"320";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_dw6sxykx";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"472.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"272";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"480";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_29sogh2l";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"664.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_jlhtpu0p";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"785.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_c3m530vx";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1129.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kej59pxa/flavor/1_51i7lrgh";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:96:"

The driver of a car that led police on a 25-mile chase through parts of Lehigh and Berks counties remains at large.</p><p>

"Racing...I mean he was flying," said witness Maurine Callmann.</p><p>

Police said the pursuit began in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, when officers tried to stop a green BMW for speeding.</p><p>

The driver, described as a thin black man about six feet tall and in his 20s, reportedly fled to Kutztown.</p><p>

Witnesses said the fugitive was driving recklessly down Main Street and other residential roads before hitting a car.</p><p>

"He clipped the back of my car, bounced off of me and it didn't even slow him down. He kept flying up the street," said David Kresge, who fortunately was not hurt.</p><p>

"He had no regard for anyone. He was running top speed. It was scary," said Kresge.</p><p>

Police said the driver then fled to residential Muhlenberg Township via Route 222 South, where he jumped from the car and fled into woods.</p><p>

The car then struck the corner of a home in the 700 block of West Bellevue Avenue. Ron Weitzel was inside at the time, but fortunately uninjured.</p><p>

"[I] felt it and heard the thump and then I heard all of the sirens," said Weitzel.</p><p>

Officers pursued the fugitive on foot with K-9 units, but the driver got away and the search was called off, police said.</p><p>

"He's around yet somewhere. It's kind of uneasy feeling," said Weitzel. "[I] keep the doors locked now, the cars locked now... about all we can do."</p><p>

Upper Macungie Deputy Chief Joseph Wilson told 69 News that the owner of the vehicle was identified but that owner was not behind the wheel. Wilson said that driver remains at large and the investigation continues.</p><p>

Wilson could not confirm whether the BMW was stolen from the owner. He said the vehicle was not reported as stolen at the time of the stop.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:141:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26023482/highRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/jbe0c5/-/Driver-in-chase-through-Lehigh-Berks-counties-at-large.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"41506";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 16 May 2014 22:47:39 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26023478";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-16T22:47:39Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1496.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_154x0qkl";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"364.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"176";s:5:"width";s:3:"320";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_1zk4a5tj";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"471.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"272";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"480";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_lbcyy4pl";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"671.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_61607xhd";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"802.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_2d218n65";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1057.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_scwdm38k/flavor/1_mr4reyya";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"

It was a touching moment between father and son as U.S. Army Staff Sgt. William Jenkins surprised his son, Corey, during a school assembly.</p><p>

"He could not wait. All he kept talking about to his teachers was I get to pick up my dad tomorrow," said U.S. Army Staff Sgt. William Jenkins. "And I wanted to surprise him today saying, 'Hey, I am home. You do not have to worry about it anymore."</p><p>

Jenkins left for his third tour to Afghanistan nine months ago.&#160;</p><p>

"It has been tough not being able to see them. We have been in contact through text messages or Skype or Facetime, however we could," said Jenkins.</p><p>

Corey thought he was at the Northeast Middle School assembly to speak about the environmental club and said he was thrilled to see his dad.&#160;</p><p>

"I am happy because my dad is home and we can spend more time together," said Corey.</p><p>

"It was a tough nine months, but I am home now and that is all that matters.

Work is underway to replace the former Seafood Shanty restaurant in Spring Township with a new dining establishment.</p><p>

Jim Lukens, owner of <a href="http://www.austinsrestaurant.com/" target="_blank">Austin's Restaurant &amp; Bar</a>, also in Spring Township, and other restaurants around the region, announced plans Friday for his newest venture.</p><p>

Coastal Grille is set to open this September in the Broadcasting Square shopping center, Lukens said.</p><p>

The building has been vacant since Seafood Shanty closed last August. The site has also been home to Mason's Chop House and Pizzeria Uno.</p><p>

Coastal Grille's menu will feature about 60 percent seafood and, like Austin's, the restaurant will offer a causal, upscale dining experience, Lukens said.</p><p>

In addition to his first restaurant, Austin's, Lukens owns <a href="http://www.jbdawsons.com/" target="_blank">J.B.

The Lehigh Valley will need 95,000 more homes in the next 25 years.</p><p>

It needs more affordable homes and apartments for low-income and modest-income households.</p><p>

It needs more homes for high-income households as well.</p><p>

And it needs more homes closer to where many people work.</p><p>

But it probably will not need many more single-family dwelling units on suburban lots aimed at the middle-class market.</p><p>

Those were just a few of the many key findings in a study of the Lehigh Valley&#8217;s housing market that was introduced to nearly 100 people by the Lehigh Valley Planning Commission late Thursday afternoon in Allentown.</p><p>

The results are being incorporated into a Lehigh Valley Regional Housing Plan, which LVPC promises will be the most significant assessment ever done on the housing market in Lehigh and Northampton counties.</p><p>

When completed before the end of August, the plan &#8211; complete with recommendations -- will serve as a guide for future residential development in both counties.</p><p>

It will show what kinds of homes are most needed and who needs them.</p><p>

Many local elected officials, municipal planners and at least two school district superintendents attended the two-hour presentation on the plan in the Rodale Room in Miller Symphony Hall, as did plus representatives of developers and lending institutions.</p><p>

Becky Bradley, LVPC&#8217;s executive director, said the plan will help her agency assist the 62 municipalities and 17 school districts in the two counties, as well as &#8220;developers, bankers, Realtors and the non-profit housing sector.&#8221;</p><p>

She said questions asked by some people in the audience during the second half of the meeting will be used to help develop the plan&#8217;s goals.</p><p>

Without such a planning tool, municipalities could approve housing developments for markets that don&#8217;t exist, explained Kyle Talente of RKG Associates, LVPC&#8217;s consultant on the plan.</p><p>

Saying successful regional housing planning will require coordination and cooperation, Talente urged those in the audience: &#8220;Let&#8217;s work together to identify ways to address the needs that are here in the Valley.&#8221;</p><p>

Objectives</p><p>

&#8220;There are certain income bands, and certain parts of the Valley, where people don&#8217;t have a very good housing choice,&#8221; said Talente. &#8220;One of the goals is how we can make that better.&#8221;</p><p>

He said another goal is to diversify the types of available housing.</p><p>

A third is more focus on rehabilitation and revitalization of existing neighborhoods. He said doing that is just as important in providing high quality housing as building new homes.</p><p>

A fourth objective is to enable developers &#8220;to diversify the supply at different income bands.&#8221;</p><p>

Said Talente: &#8220;It is not all about the low end. It also is about the high end. That&#8217;s why this is a regional housing study, not just an affordable housing study.</p><p>

&#8220;There is need at different ends of the market. How do you provide for both of them?</p><p>

&#8220;And hopefully, from a sustainability standpoint, how do you provide for both of them in the same development -- trying to build integrated communities rather than continuing to isolate by income.&#8221;</p><p>

He said now there&#8217;s an imbalance between people&#8217;s ability to pay and housing that is available.</p><p>

A housing shift</p><p>

Between 1980 and 2007, developers were proposing far more single-family dwelling units than any other type of housing in the Lehigh Valley, said David Berryman, LVPC&#8217;s chief community planner. He said that trend stopped in 2008, during the national recession.</p><p>

Since 2008, said Berryman, developers are proposing more apartments than single-family dwellings. &#8220;The amount is picking up. In the last two years, it&#8217;s almost two-to-one.&#8221;</p><p>

Today, he said, developers primarily are proposing apartments, followed by age-restricted housing.</p><p>

Berryman said some of those planned apartment developments are for what he would consider very expensive units &#8211; &#8220;$1,300 to $1,400 rents for one or two bedrooms. We aren&#8217;t seeing anything lower. Right now builders think the apartment demand is that higher end stuff.&#8221;</p><p>

Berryman said single-family homes and townhouse projects still are out there but &#8220;orbiting. They were proposed many, many years ago but have yet to be built or fully constructed.&#8221;</p><p>

With a growing number of empty-nest baby boomers and well as a growing number of younger, smaller and non-traditional households, Talente<br/>said: &#8220;Not everybody wants a five-bedroom house on three acres.&#8221;</p><p>

Housing market must grow</p><p>

Talente raced through a Power Point presentation loaded with statistics about the local housing market.</p><p>

He said the two counties will see a substantial increase in population during the next 25 years, but the average household size will decline.</p><p>

&#8220;When you have population growth and average household size decline, that translates into a growth in the total number of households, which means the demand for housing units.&#8221;</p><p>

He said that means the Valley will need about 95,000 more housing units in the next 25 years.</p><p>

The Lehigh Valley now has 256,362 housing units, he reported.</p><p>

Low vacancy rate puts pressure on market</p><p>

Talente said the vacancy rate for housing in the Valley is just under six percent. He called that &#8220;an extremely healthy market -- actually bordering on unhealthy, because is restricts mobility.&#8221;</p><p>

He explained: &#8220;If you&#8217;re in a house and you want to move, there may not be the type of house you want. You may be stuck where you are because you can&#8217;t find something else you want to move into.&#8221;</p><p>

He said home buyers are competing in a very small market, which has an impact on prices.</p><p>

Own vs. rent</p><p>

Talente said 70 percent of Valley residents own homes and 30 percent rent.</p><p>

He said it&#8217;s about a 50/50 split between owners and renters in boroughs and in the three cities.</p><p>

&#8220;As you move farther away from your urban areas, it becomes almost exclusively single-family detached,&#8221; he said, adding most of those homes are owned by the people living in them.</p><p>

More than 50 percent of the homes in the Lehigh Valley are single-family detached. Almost one quarter of the housing stock is single-family attached, concentrated in a handful of areas, including Allentown and Bethlehem.</p><p>

Talente said there is not enough housing in the Lehigh Valley for low-income and modest-income households. &#8220;It&#8217;s very challenging to provide housing at the lowest end.&#8221;</p><p>

He said there is a &#8220;tremendous correlation between education and ownership because there is a correlation between education and income. The lesser the education, the greater the proclivity to rent. Same thing for income. The less you earn, the less you can afford.</p><p>

&#8220;Twenty-five percent of the households in your community earn less than $30,000 annually. That&#8217;s a substantial finding when you start talking about moving forward with housing for the Valley.&#8221;</p><p>

He said people earning less than $47,000 are challenged to find suitable housing close to where they work. The folks that can least afford paying $3.80 a gallon for gas have to pay substantially more than they can afford for housing or commute the farthest distances.</p><p>

Allentown and Bethlehem only have about 36 percent of all the households in the Valley, but also have 54 percent of the households that earn less than $17,600.</p><p>

Talente explained anyone who is paying more than 30 percent of their gross income for housing costs is &#8220;considered to be cost burdened.&#8221;</p><p>

Between 2000 and 2010, he reported, the percentage of cost-burdened households jumped from 60 percent to more than 70 percent.</p><p>

&#8220;Incomes didn&#8217;t keep pace with housing price. Once the economy turns around, you&#8217;re going to see that number start to grow again. Seventy percent is a substantially high number.&#8221;</p><p>

Talente noted there also is not enough housing for high-income households.</p><p>

&#8220;This has an impact on your market. If I&#8217;m making over 70 grand and I want to get a house here, I have to move down the next group and consume their housing,&#8221; said the consultant.</p><p>

Demographics</p><p>

Talente said about 187,000 people live and work in the Lehigh Valley.</p><p>

Almost 89,000 come from outside the two counties to work here and more than 103,000 leave the Valley to work.</p><p>

&#8220;You&#8217;re a net exporter of labor.&#8221; He said that&#8217;s not surprising, considering the Valley&#8217;s proximity to two very large employment centers: New York City and Philadelphia.</p><p>

Between 2006 and 2010, about 5,000 more people moved into the Valley than moved out. Talente said many more people are moving in from the Philadelphia and New York City areas than are moving out of the Valley to those areas.</p><p>

&#8220;It&#8217;s a place that people want to be, both from a jobs perspective and quality of life perspective,&#8221; said Talente. &#8220;It&#8217;s more affordable.&#8221;</p><p>

He indicated median-priced homes comparable to those that sell for $400,000 in New Jersey counties near New York City can be purchased for about $200,000 in the Lehigh Valley. &#8220;I can literally get twice the amount of house here.&#8221;</p><p>

He added rent also is substantially lower.</p><p>

Almost 65,000 people who live here don&#8217;t work &#8211; &#8220;either they&#8217;re retirees or they&#8217;re unemployed.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:104:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26011692/highRes/1/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/egnavqz/-/5-16-14-lvpc-jpg.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"41798";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 16 May 2014 22:07:00 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26011676";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-16T22:07:00Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:96:"

Some quick-thinking neighbors in Reading are being credited with a heroic rescue after saving an elderly woman from fire.</p><p>

Grace Kruppenbach, 89, was pulled to safety after her home was engulfed by flames. The fire was reported around 9:15 p.m. Thursday at 534 Pike St. The fire quickly jumped to two alarms as firefighters worked to save the home.</p><p>

"Everything we put into this house and it all went up in flames," said Kruppenbach, who lived in the home with her son for 15 years.</p><p>

Tears welled up in her eyes as she looked through the front door Friday.</p><p>

"I had my checkbooks in there and I had all my medical stuff in there, and everything is gone," said Kruppenbach.</p><p>

Even her walker and canes she uses to get around were destroyed. The ceiling fan was in the middle of the floor and the roof and walls of the home were charred and splintered.</p><p>

"I saw the flames go up and I tried to get out the front of the house and I yelled for her where she was," said David Harman, Kruppenbach's son, who was cooking dinner inside at the time of the fire.</p><p>

"We were inhaling that smoke and I was choking," Kruppenbach said.</p><p>

She ran out the back door and her son went through the front. The only problem was flames were shooting out the back of the house and the fence outside was locked. That's where the neighbors came in.</p><p>

"They lifted me over the fence and the other guy on the other side helped take me out of the yard," said Kruppenbach.</p><p>

"She had to get over the fence. We picked her up. She looked like she was going to pass out, so I kind of picked her up over my shoulder a little bit and got her out of the area," said Deserie Knarr, one of the people who helped the woman.</p><p>

The neighbors pulled Kruppenbach to safety and gave her water and a jacket. Now, she wants to thank them and buy them all a card for saving her life.</p><p>

"I guess when everything is all said and done I'll just see them around and give them a hug and thank them for what they did," she said.</p><p>

The fire was sparked by cooking oil on the kitchen stove, according to Larry Moyer, the city's fire marshal.</p><p>

Three other homes suffered smoke damage. Kruppenbach and her son are staying at a hotel, but they plan to rebuild.</p><p>

"As long as everybody got out alive the neighbors they helped out that's all that matters," said Harman.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:109:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/26008208/highRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/a01ttvz/-/pike-fire-reading-jpg.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"49079";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 16 May 2014 22:02:47 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26007048";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-16T22:02:47Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:7:"content";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1334.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_korkh6nr";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:4:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"376.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"176";s:5:"width";s:3:"320";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_ug7n0xeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"473.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"272";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"480";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_u42q0557";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"633.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_k8hzrojq";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:5:"830.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_1cv4y8an";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:7:"bitrate";s:6:"1152.0";s:6:"height";s:3:"360";s:4:"type";s:9:"video/mp4";s:5:"width";s:3:"640";s:3:"url";s:86:"http://kv.wfmz.com/p/557781/sp/55778100/download/entry_id/1_kb28qwih/flavor/1_b7unc6jy";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:54:"

Lehigh County Solicitor Matthew Sorrentino stood before county commissioners Wednesday night to defend the reputation of his law firm against a claim that it has been involved in a conflict of interest regarding the tax increment financing plan for the proposed Hamilton Crossings Shopping Center in Lower Macungie Township.</p><p>

Sorrentino appeared before the commissioners at their administrative committee meeting Wednesday night, as a follow-up to a five-page letter he sent them May 9, in which he stated &#8220;no conflict of interest exists.&#8221;</p><p>

&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure there&#8217;s a great deal more I can add with respect to this subject,&#8221; Sorrentino told the commissioners. &#8220;I can&#8217;t say a lot more than I said in the letter. I&#8217;m happy to answer any additional questions you have.&#8221;</p><p>

In response to their questions, he explained why there has been no legal conflict of interest and cited the fact that the county commissioners rejected participating in the Hamilton Crossings TIF last year as &#8220;the proof in the pudding.&#8221;</p><p>

Sorrentino told the commissioners: &#8220;I don&#8217;t want my solicitors or myself to be in a position where you&#8217;re uncomfortable with the advice you are receiving.&#8221;</p><p>

He has advised the commissioners of conflict of interest policies being implemented by the county law department, which he heads. He said two of the three policies &#8220;are merely a codification of practices already followed by the county law department.&#8221;</p><p>

The third policy, being implemented for the commissioners, states that they and the county executive will be advised if any members of Sorrentino&#8217;s staff, or members of their law firms, represent other governmental agencies in any matter where the county may be involved.</p><p>

The suggestion of a conflict of interest involving Sorrentino&#8217;s law firm -- Norris McLaughlin & Marcus -- was raised in a two-page letter sent to the county commissioners on April 17 by Atty. Jonathan Hugg of Clark Hill, a Philadelphia law firm.</p><p>

Hugg represents Cedar Realty Trust, the owners of the Trexler Mall and Trexlertown shopping centers who oppose the Hamilton Crossings TIF. He regularly speaks out against the TIF at public meetings.</p><p>

The issue is that Sorrentino works for the county.</p><p>

Atty. Richard Somach, his partner at Norris McLaughlin & Marcus, is the Lower Macungie Township solicitor, whose commissioners will determine the fate of TIF financing for the shopping center on June 5.</p><p>

Atty. John Lushis, also a partner at Norris McLaughlin & Marcus, is solicitor to the Lehigh County Industrial Development Corporation, which wrote the Hamilton Crossings TIF plan.</p><p>

In his letter, Sorrentino told commissioners Norris McLaughlin & Marcus does not represent Lehigh County. &#8220;Rather, I am the Lehigh County solicitor and I am also a partner in Norris McLaughlin & Marcus.&#8221;</p><p>

Sorrentino explained the county, Lower Macungie and LCIDA are not adversaries and that the three lawyers are not pursuing inconsistent legal positions on the same legal issue, even though their clients may be seeking different political policy outcomes.</p><p>

Hugg&#8217;s letter maintained: &#8220;It is inappropriate for the solicitor&#8217;s law firm subsequently to assist proponents of the TIF as well as those that are supposed to be considering the TIF in a neutral manner.&#8221;</p><p>

Hugg stated lawyers&#8217; rules of professional conduct prohibit them from having conflicts of interest related to current and former clients.<br/>&#8220;Ultimately, a lawyer cannot represent multiple clients taking materially different positions in the same controversy unless the lawyer obtains informed consent from all the clients.&#8221;</p><p>

Hugg also maintained lawyers in one law firm cannot represent different interests.</p><p>

Noting the that county commissioners rejected participating in the TIF last year, Hugg said commissioners &#8220;should consider demanding that the solicitor&#8217;s firm disqualify itself from representing any other entity regarding the TIF.&#8221;</p><p>

On Wednesday, Commissioner Percy Dougherty explained that Hugg&#8217;s letter brought the conflict of interest issue to the county commissioners&#8217; attention.</p><p>

&#8220;In my mind, Mr. Hugg has nothing at all to do with why we&#8217;re discussing this tonight,&#8221; insisted Commissioner Scott Ott. &#8220;We&#8217;re discussing it because members of the board want to discuss it. Who brought it to our attention is irrelevant.&#8221;</p><p>

&#8220;But that&#8217;s what got it started,&#8221; said Dougherty.</p><p>

Said Sorrentino: &#8220;I have no interest, frankly, in talking about the TIF. But that is what started this. I felt when someone either between the lines or overtly accuses you of a conflict of interest, you have the obligation to respond.&#8221;</p><p>

Sorrentino said he has only tangentially involved in the TIF issue for the county and that --&#8220;with my agreement and out of an abundance of caution&#8221; &#8211; Somach and Lushis have &#8220;screened&#8221; him from the advice they gave their respective clients.</p><p>

What constitutes a conflict of interest</p><p>

The solicitor gave the commissioners a different explanation of conflict of interest than the one they received from Hugg.</p><p>

&#8220;The concept of conflict of interest, as lawyers understand it and as laid out by disciplinary rules, begins with the notion of adversity,&#8221;<br/>said Sorrentino.</p><p>

&#8220;We have to have people who are adverse to each other &#8211; opposite sides of a legal issue, opposite sides of a lawsuit. &#8220;</p><p>

As an example, Sorrentino explained to commissioners if there was an automobile accident and he represented the plaintiffs, the people injured in the accident, &#8220;one of my partners couldn&#8217;t represent the defendant. That would be an actual current conflict of interest.&#8221;</p><p>

He said it does not only apply to court cases.</p><p>

&#8220;I can&#8217;t represent the landlord and have one of my partners represent the tenant in the negotiation of a lease.</p><p>

TIF political, not legal</p><p>

&#8220;If you want me to use the TIF as an example, I can do that as well,&#8221;<br/>said Sorrentino.</p><p>

&#8220;The proponents of the TIF are the developers. They&#8217;re the people who wanted you to approve the TIF.</p><p>

&#8220;I haven&#8217;t spent a lot of time studying this, but as far I can see, the adversaries of the TIF are citizen groups who believe the development either shouldn&#8217;t move forward or should move forward without any kind of subsidy from the county government or the local government.</p><p>

&#8220;Those are the people who are adverse to each other. The governments aren&#8217;t adverse to each other. There was not a conflict with respect to the representation of those governmental bodies.&#8221;</p><p>

The solicitor indicated that when the commissioners decided not to participate in the TIF, they made a political decision, not a legal decision.</p><p>

Sorrentino told commissioners: &#8220;People come in front of you all the time and advocate for you to make decisions in their favor or against them. Your solicitors, your lawyers, don&#8217;t. The township&#8217;s lawyers and the county&#8217;s lawyers don&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p><p>

But Commissioner Vic Mazziotti, who was a member of the Hamilton Crossings TIF committee, told Sorrentino: &#8220;One of your attorneys represented the Industrial Development Authority. He was clearly a proponent for this project, beyond a doubt.</p><p>

&#8220;You could say he was representing his client, the Industrial Development Authority, which was a proponent of this project. They recommended it. I&#8217;m asking, would that qualify as a proponent?&#8221;</p><p>

&#8220;He&#8217;s representing his client,&#8221; agreed Sorrentino. He said if the Industrial Development Authority &#8220;is in the business of advocating or not advocating certain economic development, that&#8217;s just a different political decision.&#8221;</p><p>

Added Sorrentino: &#8220;Lower Macungie may recommend the project too, but that doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with the lawyers representing the adversaries or the proponents.&#8221;</p><p>

When Mazziotti noted the commissioners turned down the TIF, making them opponents, Sorrentino said that &#8220;ought to be in the proof in the pudding of this conversation.</p><p>

&#8220;With all the advice that everybody was given, this board took a path contrary to what may be another decision from another organization one of my partners represents.&#8221; He was referring to the upcoming vote by Lower Macungie commissioners.</p><p>

Ott said there is an underlying difference between what is a conflict of interest &#8220;within the law trade, so to speak, and what can appear to be a conflict of interest in a political context. Things not only have to be right, but they have to look right, they have to smell right.&#8221;</p><p>

Three principles</p><p>

In his May 9 letter to commissioners, Sorrentino laid out the three principles regarding disclosure. All promise to notify commissioners and/or the county executive of any possible or actual conflicts of interests in the county law department.</p><p>

Commissioner Michael Schware suggested those principles should be made public, perhaps on the county&#8217;s website.</p><p>

&#8220;To me, it&#8217;s public,&#8221; said Sorrentino. &#8220;I have nothing to hide.</p><p>

&#8220;The whole purpose of writing this letter was to get the transparency that I think you want.&#8221;</p><p>

Taking it a step further, Sorrentino said that, as head of the county&#8217;s law department, he is making the three principles departmental policy.</p><p>

Ott suggested the commissioners might want to consider formalizing such a policy as part of the county&#8217;s administrative code.</p><p>

&#8220;That would be fine,&#8221; said Sorrentino.</p><p>

&#8220;I trust you, I know you&#8217;re going to live by this,&#8221; said Ott. &#8220;But someday all of us will be gone and you&#8217;ll be gone. And there will be no lasting impact of this letter.&#8221;</p><p>

Dougherty told Sorrentino his letter was very comprehensive and touched on most of the points raised at the commissioners&#8217; April 23 meeting, where Hugg&#8217;s letter was discussed.</p><p>

In his letter Sorrentino said he served for years on the Disciplinary Hearing Committee of the Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, including as the committee&#8217;s chair.

Firefighters in one Lehigh County borough will have the chance to form a union.</p><p>

Emmaus firefighters will vote on Wednesday to decide whether or not they want to form a collective bargaining unit.</p><p>

The Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board ruled that the firefighters, even though long thought of as volunteers, are considered employees of the borough and will be able to take up the matter next week.</p><p>

"We're pleased with the decision and we look forward to the election taking place May 21," said Matthew Areman, spokesman for the firefighters.</p><p>

Atty. Thomas Dinkelacker, the Emmaus solicitor, said the borough disagrees with the labor board's decision. He added the borough has not decided whether or not it will appeal if the election comes down in favor of the union.</p><p>

Dinkelacker said the election will be between 4 and 8 p.m. Wednesday.</p><p>

The solicitor said whoever shows up votes, with no proxy or absentee ballots.</p><p>

He said a tie vote goes in favor of a union.</p><p>

If the measure passes, the group will be represented by the Pennsylvania Professional Fire Fighters Association.</p><p>

Fire Chief James Reiss would not be considered for the union representation.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:113:"http://www.wfmz.com/image/view/-/9234292/highRes/2/-/maxh/360/maxw/640/-/9apq0bz/-/fire-fighter--fire-hat-jpg.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"99979";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Fri, 16 May 2014 21:43:17 GMT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"26017766";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:4:"date";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:20:"2014-05-16T21:43:17Z";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:3:{s:7:"subject";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"News";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"language";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5:"en-US";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"rights";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"&copy; 2014 Maranatha Broadcasting Company, Inc.
