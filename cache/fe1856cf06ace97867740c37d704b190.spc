league season has been underway since Thursday, and with the state of the Phillies, it&#8217;s probably time for people to be acclimated with some of the minor leaguers.  For better or worse, these are the players to be looking forward to, so hopefully a few pan out for them to get back on track.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3565"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3570">Triple-A Lehigh Valley</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3566"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3592">Pitching:</b> Lehigh Valley&#8217;s rotation doesn&#8217;t really have any prospects, but four of their five starters do have major league experience.  The fifth, David Buchanan, had a pretty good showing in big league camp though.  Jonathan Pettibone will be continuing his shoulder rehab in the minors to start the season, and if he can prove he&#8217;s healthy, ideally he replaces one of the lesser starters at the back of the Phillies&#8217; rotation.  Greg Smith returns after a solid season with the IronPigs last year, and Barry Enright and Sean O&#8217;Sullivan round out the rotation.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3567">They have five relievers with ML experience, including Phillippe Aumont who had a disastrous spring training.  His stuff is almost certainly better than anyone in the Phillies&#8217; bullpen, but it doesn&#8217;t matter if he doesn&#8217;t throw strikes.  After his public comments at the end of last year when he wasn&#8217;t promoted in September, I&#8217;m surprised he&#8217;s still even in the organization.  Luis Garcia and Jeremy Horst are both on the 40 man roster, but groundball specialist Kyle Simon is the name to watch in relief.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3595"><b>Infield:</b> Maikel Franco leads a group of position players that&#8217;s wholly uninteresting, and they&#8217;re going to have a tough time scoring runs.  Cameron Rupp will be behind the plate, so at least they&#8217;ll have a little bit of right-handed power.  Jim Murphy assumes the Matt Rizzotti role of older first baseman that&#8217;s not an awful hitter, and big league veterans Andres Blanco, Reid Brignac and Ronny Cedeno will get plenty of games up the middle of the diamond.  At least Michael Martinez is gone.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3598"><b>Outfield:</b> The IronPigs only have three healthy outfielders on the roster now.  Veteran Clete Thomas has the most experience, and he&#8217;s joined by Quad-A players Steve Susdorf and Leandro Castro.  Tyson Gillies is apparently just on the temporary inactive list and will at least provide some speed if he can get on base.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3600"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3599">Double-A Reading</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3601"><b>Pitching:</b> I was initially surprised when Jesse Biddle was starting the season back in Reading, but after recalling Director of Player Development Joe Jordan&#8217;s off-season comments about how the Phillies were going to be tougher on pitchers that don&#8217;t throw enough strikes, it makes sense.  Unfortunately, his Opening Day start wasn&#8217;t much of an improvement.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3602">Severino Gonzalez is returning to Reading after making his last start of the season with them in 2013.  Throwing strikes isn&#8217;t his problem, but this will be a big test to see if his stuff will remain good enough to get batters out.  The strike throwing lefty Hoby Milner is the other somewhat interesting arm in the rotation.  In the bullpen, Ken Giles is a potential ML back-end reliever if he can throw strikes, and Tyler Knigge and Jay Johnson have had their moments in the past.  Brody Colvin is still in the organization.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3603"><b>Infield:</b> Tommy Joseph and Sebastian Valle find themselves on the same roster again, and Joseph should get as much time behind the plate as he can handle.  Valle&#8217;s ship has almost certainly sailed.  The entire infield is essentially minor league veterans and organizational players.  Maybe first baseman Chris Serritella will show a little more power in a more favorable hitting environment.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3604"><b>Outfield:</b> This is a pretty deep-ish outfield, and getting everyone the at-bats they need will be a challenge for manager Dusty Wathan.  Aaron Altherr, Kelly Dugan and Cameron Perkins all have to play every day, and Zach Collier really should too.  Anthony Hewitt is also on the roster, and at the very least, he showed that he should still be playing a bit with his speed and power.</p>
<p><b>Class A-Advanced Clearwater</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3607"><b>Pitching:</b> Clearwater has by far the weakest roster in the organization at the start of the season.  Their opening day starter was Colin Kleven who only pitched 11.1 innings last year with a broken spine.  Ethan Stewart once showed some promise, but with more walks than strikeouts last year, it&#8217;s hard to say that now.  Jon Prosinski was the second pitcher they drafted in 2013 whose amateur status was not torpedoed by the organization, and he&#8217;s with the Threshers after throwing only 37.1 innings for Lakewood.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3605">The only top 30 prospect in the organization according to Baseball America on the roster is reliever Dan Child.  He has middle relief potential, but it&#8217;s not a good sign when your best prospect is an 18th round pick coming out of the bullpen.  The 6&#8217;7 Nic Hanson was solid for Lakewood last year, but he&#8217;s starting this season on the DL.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3606"><b>Infield:</b> Logan Moore, a Clearwater veteran who can&#8217;t hit at all, will be behind the plate again.  He&#8217;ll be joined by another returning player, former third rounder Harold Martinez who has also not hit as a professional, although he did bat .325 in 2013&#8242;s second half.  Art Charles and Willie Carmona offer a bit of power potential, but a potentially interesting name is shortstop K.C. Serna.  He&#8217;s 24 years old and spent the last two years in Indy baseball.  He was a productive player at the plate, but his calling card is above average defense at shortstop.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3608"><b>Outfield:</b> There&#8217;s probably even less going on in the Thresher outfield.  Left fielder Peter Lavin is in his third season there and should consider taking up permanent residence.  Brian Pointer has a little power, but he doesn&#8217;t make good contact enough to take advantage of it.  Justin Parr was their eighth round pick last year but didn&#8217;t have a good pro debut.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3609"><b>Class A Lakewood</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3611"><b>Pitching:</b> Lakewood&#8217;s pitching staff isn&#8217;t any better than Clearwater&#8217;s.  After a strong pro debut, Mark Leiter Jr. is actually one of their more intriguing names in the rotation, and as an experienced 23 year old, he shouldn&#8217;t have a problem getting outs in the South Atlantic League.  32nd rounder Tyler Viza signed right out of high school, and he was assigned to Lakewood in his first full season despite the expectation that he&#8217;d be raw and take some time to get going as a professional.  He&#8217;s also the youngest pitcher on the roster.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3612">It doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s much potential in the bullpen either.  Tyler Buckley has a nice curveball, and if he can throw more strikes, maybe he could reach the majors someday.  One notable name not here is former first rounder Mitch Gueller; he struggled with Williamsport last year, and he must not have shown he&#8217;s ready for Lakewood this spring.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3613"><b>Infield:</b> Deivi Grullon is not getting an early season look with the BlueClaws, and that&#8217;s okay because he&#8217;s still so young.  Gabriel Lino, the young catcher acquired for Jim Thome two years ago, will be behind the plate, and he still has potential with a strong arm and power potential.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3614">Out in the field is where the real potential lies, especially on the left side with J.P. Crawford and Zach Green.  Crawford was very impressive in his pro debut last year, and Green has big power potential.  Crawford&#8217;s double play partner will be Andrew Pullin.  He didn&#8217;t hit as well as expected last year for Williamsport, but he should have a nice approach with good bat-to-ball ability.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1396921911709_3616"><b>Outfield:</b> Carlos Tocci and Larry Greene return from last year&#8217;s team to no one&#8217;s surprise.  Greene&#8217;s first few games have actually been productive, so maybe this season he finally bothered coming into camp in shape.  Tocci has gotten stronger since last season, and hopefully that results in better contact in 2014.  The powerful Dylan Cozens makes his full-season debut alongside those two returning players.</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11817">In the final third of the list, the top three prospects are actually a really strong start to a system.  They&#8217;re almost consensus top 100 players in the industry, which is the best representation they&#8217;ve had in prospect lists since the disaster that was the Hunter Pence trade.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11818">After that, the picture is cloudier.  For the second straight year, I&#8217;m higher than everyone else on Cesar Hernandez at number four.  There are certainly quite a few players in the organization with more upside, but they&#8217;re almost certainly far away from the majors or come with other significant risks.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11824">Then there&#8217;s Miguel Gonzalez.  Because he was a professional in Cuba, he&#8217;s not listed on some prospect list, but I included him despite every bit of news about him for the past six months.  I probably could&#8217;ve stuck him one spot lower, but maybe he can get healthy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11827"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11826">10. RHP Ethan Martin, 6&#8217;2 195, 25, Triple-A (115.2 IP, 4.12 ERA, 1.39 WHIP, 21.7 K%, 13.6 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11828"><b>Strengths:</b> Martin made his big league debut last year and showed some of the swing and miss stuff that made him a first round pick in 2008.  His fastball could be a great pitch, touching the mid-90&#8242;s with movement.  His curveball and slider are both potential above average pitches, with his curveball being the more effective of the two.  The curveball has sharp vertical movement, while his slider is a flatter pitch that often acts more like a cutter.  He has a big and durable frame.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11830"><b>Weaknesses:</b> It would be an understatement to say Martin struggles with command and control.  He&#8217;s had trouble throwing strikes his entire career, and when he does, it&#8217;s a poorly located fastball up in the zone.  With these problems, it&#8217;s exceedingly likely he ends up as a reliever.  He was extremely ineffective in the big league rotation in 2013.  His changeup is below average, and he struggles against lefties.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11831"><b>2014 outlook:</b> With his shoulder injury keeping him out for most of if not all of spring training, Martin will almost certainly be starting the season in the minors.  He should work as a starter to develop his changeup, but if the Phillies need to call up someone for the bullpen at any point, he should be an option.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11833"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11832">9. CF Carlos Tocci, R/R 6&#8217;2 160, 18, Low-A (459 PA, .209/.261/.249, 16.8 K%, 4.8 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11834"><b>Strengths:</b> Tocci is a great athlete that benefits him on the bases and in the field.  For a young player, he&#8217;s a pretty smart defender in center field and should be well above average at the position.  His arm is decent.  At the plate, he&#8217;s not a hacker like many inexperienced hitters.  His walk rate wasn&#8217;t very good, but he doesn&#8217;t strike out much and knows how to get the bat on the ball.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11835"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Tocci is really, really skinny and needs to add strength.  Good velocity pretty much knocks the bat out of his hands, and even if he can make contact, it&#8217;s hardly ever meaningful at present.  Even if he adds strength, his game is still raw in all other areas.  Despite his speed, he stole bases at less than a 50% clip.  He&#8217;s never going to hit for power, but he could at least hit the ball into the gaps a little in the future.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11836"><b>2014 outlook:</b> This will be Tocci&#8217;s second full season as a professional, and he&#8217;ll still only be 18 years old for almost all of the season.  He&#8217;s evidently 10 pounds heavier than he was at this time last year, and that could be a big difference for his game.  He&#8217;ll be back at Lakewood, likely for the entire season where he&#8217;ll again be one of the youngest player in the South Atlantic League.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11838"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11837">8. CF Aaron Altherr, R/R 6&#8217;5 190, 23, High-A (527 PA, .275/.337/.455, 26.6 K%, 8.5 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11839"><b>Strengths:</b> Altherr had a breakout season with Clearwater in 2013, tapping into his power potential to set career highs in home runs and slugging.  He&#8217;s one of the best athletes in the system, allowing him to play a quality center field and steal bases effectively.  He has a decent arm that would play in right field if necessary.  His plate approach improved in 2013 with the highest walk rate since his pro debut in 2009.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11841"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Altherr&#8217;s track record of success is still limited.  Although his average was solid, he still struck out too much and could have benefited from a high BABIP (.360).  Like plenty of other tall players, his swing is pretty long, and he can get tied up inside.  Wrist surgery in the off-season has limited him in camp so far, and he has to show he can get back to health and hit like last year.  Some would like to see him play with more energy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11843"><b>2014 outlook:</b> If Altherr can get back to full participation in spring training, he should start the season in Reading for the greatest test of his career.  He wasn&#8217;t very good in Arizona Fall League action, but he was probably affected by his wrist injury.  Upper level pitching will be able to better expose his weaknesses.</p>
<p><b>7. RHP Severino Gonzalez, 6&#8217;1 153, 21, Low-A/High-A/Double-A (103.2 IP, 2.00 ERA, 1.02 WHIP, 29.3 K%, 5.4 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11844"><b>Strengths:</b> Gonzalez was the best pop-up prospect in the organization in 2013, coming out of nowhere to finish his season with Reading.  He&#8217;s known more for his pitchability than his stuff.  He throws a ton of strikes, many of them being quality strikes, and mixes up his wide array of pitches well.  His fastball has improved quite a bit since signing, now hovering around 90 MPH.  His curveball is probably his best secondary pitch, and he works in a changeup and cutter.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11845"><b>Weaknesses:</b> His career high in innings is 103.2, and with a small frame, he has to prove he can handle a starter&#8217;s workload.  With an average fastball, he margin for error is very small.  None of his pitches project to be plus.  Left-handed hitters had much more success against him, and he needs to improve his changeup or cutter to be more effective against him.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11846"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Gonzalez should start the season back with Reading.  It&#8217;s not out of the question that he reaches the majors at some point this year if the Phillies are hit with injuries again, but it certainly wouldn&#8217;t be bad for him to just stick at one level for a while after going through three last year.</p>
<p><b>6. RHP Miguel Gonzalez, 6&#8217;3 195, 27</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11847"><b>Strengths:</b> At his best, Gonzalez gets swings and misses with his splitter.  He pitches with a fastball that has above average velocity and can sometimes touch the mid-90&#8242;s.  His changeup is another above average pitch.  Pitching in Cuba, he tended to throw a lot of strikes.  Theoretically, he should be fresh after not pitching much in recent years after his defection.  His mid-70&#8242;s curveball could be an average pitch.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> An elbow problem in his physical cost Gonzalez about $36 million.  Lingering injuries have been a challenge so far in spring training.  He was unable to pitch at all in the off-season and does not seem prepared to start this season.  While he generally throws strikes, his fastball command is very inconsistent, and that has been evident in spring training.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Ever since originally signing last summer, it seems like nothing has gone right for Gonzalez.  It seems almost certain that he starts the season in the minors since he can&#8217;t get over his nagging injuries long enough to build up his workload to last as a starter.  If I had to do this list again, I&#8217;d likely have him quite a bit lower.</p>
<p><b>5. RF Kelly Dugan, L/R 6&#8217;3 195, 23, High-A/Double-A (474 PA, .291/.352/.506, 24.1 K%, 6.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Dugan was mostly healthy in 2013, and he proved that his bat and power weren&#8217;t flukes despite some struggles upon reaching Reading.  He hit a career high 20 home runs between Clearwater and Reading.  Despite a long swing, he has a decent feel for contact and could hit for a decent average.  He has a strong arm and has improved his defense to be average in right field.  He gave up switch hitting, but he actually hit lefties well in 2013.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Dugan&#8217;s plate approach is a bit too aggressive, and his 2.2 BB% in Double-A was abysmal.  If he can&#8217;t be more patient and wait for his pitch, his hit tool and raw power won&#8217;t play in games.  He&#8217;s not much of an athlete, and his injury history is already pretty extensive.  He&#8217;s mostly a pull hitter.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Dugan will probably be back at Reading to start the season, and if he can improve on his plate approach and stay healthy, he won&#8217;t finish the year there.  He&#8217;s not an impact player, but he&#8217;s on the cusp of the majors and could add a bit of pop to a lineup that desperately needs it.</p>
<p><b>4. 2B Cesar Hernandez, S/R 5&#8217;10 175, 24, Triple-A (440 PA, .309/.375/.402, 18.4 K%, 9.3 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Hernandez is a major league ready player with decent ability.  He&#8217;s a very good athlete that can steal bases efficiently, and that athleticism aids him at all of the up-the-middle positions.  He&#8217;s best at second base, but he can hold his own at center field and even shortstop if they were to try it.  He&#8217;s a line drive hitter with gap power, and he&#8217;s shown he can hit adequately from both sides of the plate.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Hernandez doesn&#8217;t offer impact upside and has very little power.  He has to prove he can maintain the higher walk rate he showed in 2013.  His arm is just average, and it would probably be best if he&#8217;s not used at shortstop often.  He could probably show energy on the field a little more consistently.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> I was prepared to write that Hernandez was out of options with no clear role on the Phillies, but it appears that he has a fourth option season thanks to some of baseball&#8217;s nonsensical and complex roster and service time rules.  He should head back to Lehigh Valley and perform well.</p>
<p><b>3. SS J.P. Crawford, L/R 6&#8217;2 180, 19, Rookie/Short-season A (228 PA, .308/.405/.400, 15.4 K%, 14.0 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Crawford is a great athlete and should be a plus defender at shortstop with good range and an above average arm.  He&#8217;s a smart player that will help him steal bases effectively and improve his footwork defensively.  He has a contact oriented swing and hit much better than expected in his pro debut.  His plate approach was also better than expected with as many walks as strikeouts in the Gulf Coast League.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11848"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Crawford&#8217;s still raw and has a lot of adjustments to make.  Rookie league success obviously doesn&#8217;t always result in success at higher levels.  He&#8217;s still very skinny and needs to get stronger to be sure he can continue hitting fastballs as he climbs the ladder.  Sometimes, his swing can get lengthy, and he needs to stay quick to the ball because he&#8217;s never going to have much power.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11849"><b>2014 outlook:</b> After an impressive debut that saw him reach a full-season league, Crawford should return to Lakewood to start the year.  He set a pretty high bar for himself in 2013, but he works hard to give himself a chance to continue clearing that bar.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11851"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11850">2. LHP Jesse Biddle, 6&#8217;4 225, 22, Double-A (138.1 IP, 3.64 ERA, 1.35 WHIP, 26.2 K%, 14.0 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11852"><b>Strengths:</b> Biddle&#8217;s best pitch is his slow curveball that can induce swings and misses and throw off batters&#8217; timing.  In his 2013 Futures Game appearance, the pitch averaged 70.69 MPH, and it only takes one hand to count how many active pitchers throw curveballs slower than that.  His fastball is above average in the low-90&#8242;s, and he has the big frame to hold up over the course of a long season.  He was third in the Eastern League in strikeouts, just five behind former Phillie prospect Trevor May for the league lead.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11853"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Biddle&#8217;s command, especially with his fastball, is not good and hasn&#8217;t shown any improvement in his career.  His 14.0% walk rate in 2013 was the worst of his career.  His second half was poor, and ideally that can be attributed to a case of whooping cough and a foot injury.  He has to continue improving his changeup.  Batters sitting on his slow curve can hit it.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11854"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Biddle will start the season in Lehigh Valley and has a good chance to make his big league debut at some point later in the year.  If he can&#8217;t throw more strikes, it&#8217;s going to limit his upside.  Not only does he need to be more efficient to last deeper in games, throwing strikes with his fastball will make his other pitches more effective.</p>
<p><b>1. 3B Maikel Franco, R/R 6&#8217;1 180, 21, High-A/Double-A (581 PA, .320/.356/.569, 12.0 K%, 5.2 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Franco can hit.  With his strength, bat speed and swing path, he has plus or better power and could hit 25 or more home runs annually.  He&#8217;s more of a hitter with power than power hitter, a small but important distinction.  He has a great feel for contact and can make hard contact on pitches not in the zone.  He doesn&#8217;t strike out very much.  With his hand-eye coordination, he can extend at-bats despite his aggressiveness.  He has a strong arm at third base.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11855"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Franco is not an athlete at all, and his range at third base will likely never be more than passable.  The Phillies probably wish he would show a little more interest in improving his defense.  Poor footwork can lead to inaccurate throws.  All of these problems could lead to a move to first base, which the Phillies are already preparing for.  Although he can hit a lot of pitches in and out of the strike zone, it would be beneficial if he was a little more patient and didn&#8217;t chase so many breaking balls.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1395197692104_11856"><b>2014 outlook: </b>Franco should start the season with Lehigh Valley, one step away from the majors.  He could keep hitting his way through the system, but the performances of Cody Asche and Ryan Howard will play a big role in when he gets promoted.  If he can tighten up his approach just a little bit, he&#8217;s a potential All-Star.</p>

<p>In the middle portion of this year&#8217;s top 30, there was something that surprised me: there&#8217;s actually some talent.  Unfortunately, much of it has been impacted by serious injuries, and those players may not be the same when they come back in 2014.  I count five players that would probably be ranked higher if they were healthy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_6541"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_6540">20. LHP Yoel Mecias, 6&#8217;2 160, 20, Low-A (57 IP, 3.79 ERA, 1.37 WHIP, 28.3 K%, 10.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_6543"><b>Strengths:</b> Since arriving in the U.S. in 2012 after signing in 2010, Mecias has pitched well despite being younger than most players he&#8217;s competing against.  He has a plus or better changeup that allowed him to strike out righties and lefties alike at a high rate.  His fastball already has average velocity in the high-80&#8242;s to low-90&#8242;s, and he has the frame to get stronger and pitch at a higher level more consistently.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7036"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Mecias underwent Tommy John surgery after last pitching a game in June, and he&#8217;ll likely miss most of the season.  He&#8217;ll have to show he can continue pitching as well as he had in his prior career 98.2 innings.  His breaking ball probably won&#8217;t be better than average.  Improving his fastball velocity isn&#8217;t a sure thing.  Like most young pitchers, he has to throw strikes more consistently.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7037"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Even if the Phillies give Mecias more than 12 months since his surgery to get him back on a mound, he should still be able to get at least a month of work in at the end of the season.  If he can work his way back, his upside is higher than most pitchers in the system.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7039"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7038">19. C Andrew Knapp, S/R 6&#8217;1 175, 22, Short-season (247 PA, .253/.340/.401, 23.1 K%, 8.9 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7040"><b>Strengths:</b> Knapp could develop into a solid all-around catcher adding value both at and behind the plate.  He had an okay pro debut in the New York-Penn League&#8217;s difficult hitting environment, hitting quite a bit better from the left side.  He has a decent approach and should be able to hit for a higher average in the future with some power.  He&#8217;s pretty new to playing catcher, but he is athletic.  His arm is pretty good.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7041"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Knapp also underwent Tommy John surgery, his coming during instructional league season.  Since he&#8217;s a position player, he won&#8217;t miss the whole year, but he probably will be out a significant time period.  Because of his inexperience at catcher, he has work to do receiving pitches and calling games.  His swing may be more geared toward contact than power.  His bat was poor from the right side in his debut.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7042"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Knapp should be able to play around half the season, eventually working himself in at catcher regularly after a while.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7044"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7043">18. RHP Ken Giles, 6&#8217;2 190, 23, High-A (25.2 IP, 6.31 ERA, 1.64 WHIP, 28.3 K%, 15.8 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7045"><b>Strengths:</b> Giles has one of the hardest fastballs in the minors, recording a pitch at 101 MPH in Arizona Fall League action.  The pitch averaged over 97 MPH.  His mid-80&#8242;s slider was an effective swing and miss pitch as well.  With his stuff, he could be a late inning reliever in the majors as soon as sometime this year.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7046"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Giles struggles to command both pitches at times.  This is especially important with his fastball which is somewhat of a flat pitch.  The consistency of his breaking ball wavers. Last year, he had two separate stints on the disabled list with an oblique injury and only threw 36 innings between Clearwater and the AFL.  If his command doesn&#8217;t improve, he could pitch a lot like Phillippe Aumont; flashing dominance at times but always leaving fans wanting more.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7051"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Giles should start the season in Reading and make his big league debut at some point this year.  His stuff is good enough that he should rise to the top in a big league bullpen with a lot of young arms but little certainty.  First, he has to stay healthy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7050"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7049">17. RHP Shane Watson, 6&#8217;4 200, 20, Low-A (72 IP, 4.75 ERA, 1.26 WHIP, 17.2 K%, 9.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7047"><b>Strengths:</b> Watson has two potential plus pitches, led by a sharp curveball with depth.  His fastball sits in the low-90&#8242;s, and he can dial it up a few more ticks when needed.  He has confidence in his stuff and attacks batters.  He&#8217;s shown the aptitude to smooth out his delivery and is willing to throw his changeup and try to improve it.  The pitch has average potential.  His size lends itself to good durability.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7048"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Undiagnosed diabetes cut his pro debut short in 2012, and after 16 starts last year, he was shut down with shoulder discomfort.  He had surgery in the off-season, but the organization expects him to pitch this season.  He only has 79 career innings and probably won&#8217;t be accumulating many more even if he can come back later in the year.  Despite the stuff, his results were inconsistent, and his strikeout rate was just okay.  He has to improve his command and changeup.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7052"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Despite being drafted a year ahead of high school teammate J.P. Crawford, the disruptions have caused him to fall behind in his development.  If the Phillies allow him to rehab out of the short-season leagues this year, he could throw some innings in Clearwater.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7054"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7053">16. SS Roman Quinn, S/R 5&#8217;10 170, 21, Low-A (298 PA, .238/.323/.346, 21.5 K%, 9.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7055"><b>Strengths:</b> Before his injury, Quinn&#8217;s game-changing speed placed him among the fastest runners in professional baseball.  He uses it effectively and steals at a pretty high efficiency.  He&#8217;s patient enough to draw walks to get on base to utilize his speed.  Despite his low average, his hit tool could be above average, especially from the right side.  He has surprising pop for his size and can drive the ball into the gaps.  His arm is strong.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7056"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Quinn&#8217;s season ended prematurely in June when he broke his wrist, an injury that can be devastating for hitters.  Over the off-season, he ruptured his achilles and will miss at least half the season.  His value is tied almost entirely to his speed, and it&#8217;s certainly possible it never fully comes back.  He has to put the ball in play more and give his legs a chance to get on base.  He&#8217;s new to switch hitting and has a lot of work to do from the left side.  He&#8217;s clumsy at shortstop, especially making throws.  A move to second base, or more likely center field, is almost certain.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7057"><b>2014 outlook:</b> When and if Quinn comes back in 2014, it&#8217;ll probably be at Clearwater.  It&#8217;ll be at least a calendar year since he last played, and that missed developmental time can be crucial, especially for a player with so much to work on.  His two injuries can significantly affect his future.</p>
<p><b>15. 3B Zach Green, R/R 6&#8217;3 210, 20, Short-season (311 PA, .252/.344/.478, 29.3 K%, 10.0 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Green led the New York-Penn League in doubles and home runs and also won the league&#8217;s home run derby.  His strength and power profiles at third base where he moved after signing with the Phillies.  He has the arm strength for the position too and has just enough quickness to stay there.  He can take walks to add to his value.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Green struggles with pitch recognition and strikes out far too much.  He sells out for power, and his swing can get too long.  There&#8217;s a real possibility he never hits for an adequate average.  Trying to hit the ball the other way instead of pulling every pitch could help out significantly.  He&#8217;s going to have to work to remain athletic enough to stay at third base.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Green will move up to full-season ball for the first time.  With his swing and miss problem and distance from the majors, he&#8217;s still a very risky prospect.  Hitting for the power he did in the NYPL is impressive though, and he could become an even more dangerous hitter if he makes better contact.</p>
<p><b>14. C Deivi Grullon, R/R 6&#8217;1 180, 18, Rookie (132 PA, .273/.333/.364, 13.6 K%, 7.6 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7060"><b>Strengths:</b> Grullon could be an elite defender behind the plate.  A large part of that is his potential 80 grade arm which will allow him to control the running game.  He&#8217;s a smart player who has shown quick improvement in calling games and handling a staff.  He&#8217;s pretty athletic and has the strength and durability to play the position.  He has a good plate approach that puts the ball in play consistently, and his performance at the plate in 2013 was better than expected.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7058"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Even so, Grullon&#8217;s offensive upside is pretty limited, especially his power.  He&#8217;ll likely top out as an empty average hitter with a little on-base ability.  He&#8217;s still very young, and Gulf Coast League performance is not at all indicative of future performance.  Although his defense is advanced, he still needs work behind the plate moving side to side and blocking balls.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7059"><b>2014 outlook:</b> I could see the Phillies giving Grullon at shot at Lakewood to start the season but move down to the NYPL in June if he shows he&#8217;s not ready.  He&#8217;s still very far away from the majors, but his defensive ability is rare.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7062"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7061">13. C Cameron Rupp, R/R 6&#8217;1 240, 25, Double-A/Triple-A (355 PA, .258/.318/.437, 25.6 K%, 6.8 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7063"><b>Strengths:</b> While not as good as Grullon, Rupp is also a solid defender behind the plate.  He has a strong and accurate arm.  Despite his size, he can move and block balls in the dirt.  He&#8217;s a leader and does a great job handling pitchers.  He has the strength to pull some balls and put a few of them over the fence, and his 14 home runs in 2013 were a career high.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Other than that, Rupp isn&#8217;t much of a hitter.  His swing is long, his pitch recognition isn&#8217;t good, and he&#8217;s never going to hit for a good average.  His overall upside is very limited, and there&#8217;s almost no chance he&#8217;ll be an everyday player.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7067"><b>2014 outlook:</b> After finishing last season in the majors and the trade of Erik Kratz, for two days it appeared Rupp was set to begin 2014 as Carlos Ruiz&#8217;s backup.  Then they signed Wil Nieves to a major league deal, leaving him with a ticket back to Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7066"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7065">12. LHP Adam Morgan, 6&#8217;1 195, 24, Triple-A (71.1 IP, 4.04 ERA, 1.54 WHIP, 15.3 K%, 8.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7064"><b>Strengths:</b> When healthy, Morgan&#8217;s fastball sits in the low-90&#8242;s, and he generally commands his pitches well thanks to a repeatable delivery.  His best pitch is a plus or better slider that allowed him to strike out over a batter an inning during his breakout 2012 season.  He rounds out his arsenal with an above average changeup and average curveball.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7068"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Morgan missed most of 2012 with a shoulder injury, and surgery on that shoulder in January will keep him out at least half the season.  After that, he&#8217;ll have to prove he can reach the level he was at prior to the injury.  He needs to locate his fastball and keep it low in the zone.  He allowed 10 home runs in 71.1 innings in 2013 after only allowing nine in 158.2 in 2012.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7069"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Morgan will probably begin the comeback trail in the GCL when he&#8217;s ready to pitch in June or July.  It would be nice to see him make his debut later in the year, but I would expect the Phillies to bring him back slowly.  This year is all about staying healthy.</p>

<p><b>Strengths:</b> Through the first two months of the season, Perkins was on fire, posting a .894 OPS, but after breaking his wrist in June, he wasn&#8217;t the same hitter.  He still finished among the Florida State League batting leaders thanks to his feel for contact and putting the ball in play.  He still has the frame to add more strength, and that would help him hit for the additional power he needs to be a corner outfielder.  After playing third base as an amateur, he took to right field pretty well and could be average at the position.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> After returning from his wrist injury, Perkins batted just .250 with a .682 OPS.  He was just okay in the AFL over the off-season, and he still has to prove he can be the same hitter he was before he got hurt.  He needs to wait for his pitch a little more instead of making outs with weak contact.  It&#8217;s not a sure thing that his doubles power translates to home run power down the road.  His arm is just average.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393988945746_7078"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Perkins should start 2014 in Reading, where he probably would&#8217;ve finished 2013 if he hadn&#8217;t gotten hurt.  If he can hit well again, he&#8217;ll put himself in the mix for a corner outfield spot in the near future.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re now two and a half years since the Phillies acquired Hunter Pence, and the farm system has still not recovered to the level it was once at.  After missing the playoffs two straight years, and frankly not being particularly close, they need a new wave of players to come up and make an impact.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re spending more money in the international market to try and add to the farm&#8217;s talent level, and their top 10 pick in the upcoming draft will help.  In the short term, the Phillies are hurt by a couple things: their recent bush league dealings with the NCAA, and a number of significant injuries to key players.</p>
<p>One area the team has improved their depth in is power hitting.  It&#8217;s been an issue at the major league level for a while now, but maybe help is coming.  Depending on how I&#8217;m feeling that particular day, I count around seven players on my top 30 list that could be potential 20+ home run hitters.  Of course not all of them will pan out, but maybe they can hit on two or three players and rebuild the lineup.</p>
<p>Listed ages are for the 2014 season, and the league level and stats are from 2013.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21028"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21027">30. 2B Andrew Pullin, L/R 6&#8217;0 190, 20, Short-season (219 PA, .261/.283/.412, 16.9 K%, 3.2 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21033"><b>Strengths:</b> Pullin can hit, despite the disappointing average (which was still nearly 20 points better than league average in 2013.)  He has a good feel for contact that helps him put the ball and play and avoid strikeouts.  Despite his smaller size, he has a bit of pop in his bat with 18 extra base hits in 51 games.  After converting to second base, he has the athleticism and arm to be average at the position.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21034"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Pullin clearly has to work on his plate approach; not only to eventually take walks but just wait for pitches he can make hard contact on.  Players with good hit tools can be their own worst enemy when they think they can hit every pitch but end up making a lot of weak contact.  Because he&#8217;s not adding much with his defense or speed, he&#8217;s going to have to hit a lot better to have value.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21035"><b>2014 outlook:</b> At this time last year, there was a possibility that Pullin would start the season in Lakewood thanks to his advanced bat.  His average play a level lower indicated he wouldn&#8217;t have been prepared for that, but he&#8217;ll get his shot in full-season ball this year.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21037"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21036">29. LHP Austin Wright, 6&#8217;4 235, 24, Double-A (94.1 IP, 5.92 ERA, 1.59 WHIP, 17.7 K%, 13.5 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21038"><b>Strengths:</b> Wright has the strong, durable frame to start if the Phillies choose to continue that route with him.  His fastball sits in the low-90&#8242;s and could maybe touch a little higher in relief.  His changeup velocity has nice separation from his fastball around 10 MPH, allowing him to have success against righties.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21039"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Wright was probably a bit overrated after winning Florida State League Pitcher of the Year in 2012, but there was no indication his 2013 season would be so bad.  For most of the year, he couldn&#8217;t find the strike zone, and when he did, the pitch was poorly located and hit hard.  His high-effort delivery and tendency to lose fastball velocity during a game are more conducive to a relief role.  His breaking ball is only average.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21040"><b>2014 outlook:</b> It&#8217;s impossible to predict how a pitcher can rebound coming off a season like Wright&#8217;s.  All things considered, he should probably stay in the bullpen.  Maybe an off-season to clear his head will help him get back closer to the strike zone in 2014 and pitch more effectively.</p>
<p><b>28. RHP Kyle Simon, 6&#8217;6 220, 23, Double-A (56.2 IP, 4.45 ERA, 1.41 WHIP, 12.9 K%, 8.6 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21041"><b>Strengths:</b> Simon&#8217;s high-80&#8242;s sinker makes him a ground ball machine.  His size and release point accentuate the effectiveness of the pitch.  His slider and changeup both have potential to be average pitches, although he doesn&#8217;t need both in the bullpen.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Elbow soreness affected Simon earlier in the season, and he pitched poorly for most of the season.  According to Pitch F/X data from his two seasons in the Arizona Fall League, it may have negatively affected his velocity, and his walk rate was the highest in his career.  Because of his arm angle and mediocre changeup, he struggles against left-handed batters.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21042"><b>2014 outlook:</b> Unlike last season, Simon was not awarded a non-roster invitation to big league camp, so he&#8217;s going to have to work his way back on the map.  Ideally, his poor season can be explained away by his elbow, and he&#8217;ll be ready to go, likely for Reading, in April.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21046"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21045">27. OF Jose Pujols, R/R 6&#8217;3 175, 18, Rookie (181 PA, .188/.278/.369, 30.9 K%, 10.5 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21043"><b>Strengths:</b> Pujols is sometimes compared to former Phillies prospect (and potential top 100 prospect) Domingo Santana.  Santana was a bit bigger at that age and performed well right out of the gate, but the tools are similar.  He has big-time, top of the scale power, and his six home runs were tied for the Gulf Coast League lead.  He generates that power with tremendous bat speed, and he has a lot of room to grow stronger.  His above average arm should land him in right field.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21044"><b>Weaknesses:</b> Pujols has the desire to swing at every pitch, and at some point he has to stop doing that.  The raw power will never play in games unless he figures out some semblance of pitch recognition.  He&#8217;ll probably always strike out, but doing so in nearly one-third of his plate appearances isn&#8217;t particularly close to being tolerable.  He&#8217;s already pretty slow and won&#8217;t be getting faster as he gets bigger.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21047"><b>2014 outlook:</b> The Phillies like challenging young players with assignments to Lakewood, but that seems to be out of the question with Pujols.  There&#8217;s nothing wrong with an 18 year old repeating the GCL if that&#8217;s where he&#8217;s assigned again.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21049"><b id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21048">26. CF Zach Collier, L/L 6&#8217;2 185, 23, Double-A (513 PA, .222/.310/.348, 25.1 K%, 9.2 BB%)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_ym1_1_1393172809777_21050"><b>Strengths:</b> Collier has the athleticism to play a good center field, and he has the arm strength to play any outfield position.  That athleticism also helps him on the bases where he could steal 20+ bases annually at a somewhat efficient rate.  He has an approach patient enough to take some walks.  He can generate decent bat speed.  He posted a .918 OPS in August to close out 2013.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Unfortunately, the rest of his season was horrendous, and he entered August batting below .200.  Collier has never been able to translate his athleticism and tools into in-game production and has a career OPS of just .664.  Although his eight home runs in 2013 were a career high, his power is underwhelming.  He struck out in nearly one-third of his plate appearances against left-handed pitchers.  His injury history is already pretty extensive.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook: </b>It feels like Collier has been around forever, but he&#8217;s still too young to throw in the towel.  If he can just hit a little bit, he should find himself on a major league bench thanks to his speed and defense.  He&#8217;ll probably be headed back to Reading.</p>
<p><b>25. C Tommy Joseph, R/R 6&#8217;1 215, 22, Triple-A (72 PA, .209/.264/.358, 20.8 K%, 5.6 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> With his strength and swing geared for it, Joseph has above average to plus power to all fields.  Behind the plate, he has the arm strength to control the running game and owns a career 35% caught stealing rate.  His leadership and game calling are good intangibles for a catcher to have.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> 2013 was a lost year for Joseph after suffering two concussions and dealing with the symptoms the entire season.  There was doubt that he&#8217;d ever play catcher again, but the Phillies seem to be proceeding with him behind the plate which is probably his only path to the big leagues because his bat&#8217;s not good enough to profile at first base.  He doesn&#8217;t have the hit tool to hit for a very good average, and he doesn&#8217;t help himself with an aggressive approach.  Because of his size, he has to improve blocking balls in the dirt and other aspects of catching related to agility.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Joseph just staying on the field will be a positive.  If he&#8217;s going to be behind the plate every day, Reading seems like a more likely destination than Lehigh Valley with Cameron Rupp headed for the IronPigs.  Continuing to play catcher is almost certainly detrimental to his long-term health, but it&#8217;s hard to picture him lasting in the big leagues long if he&#8217;s playing first base.</p>
<p><b>24. RHP Mitch Gueller, 6&#8217;3 210, 20, Short-season (58.1 IP, 5.86 ERA, 1.87 WHIP, 12.5 K%, 9.3 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Gueller is a big athlete with the body to withstand a full starters&#8217; workload in the future.  He has an above average fastball in the low-90&#8242;s, and he shows flashes of an above average breaking ball.  He&#8217;s coachable and has been able to improve his changeup.  His athleticism should aid him as he tries to straighten out his delivery.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Gueller&#8217;s performance as a pro has been poor.  Even though he was billed as a raw pitcher despite his present fastball velocity, he doesn&#8217;t seem to be showing much progress.  Inconsistency repeating his delivery leads to a lot of his problems throwing strikes.  He has to sharpen his breaking ball and improve his changeup to have a full arsenal of pitches.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> His performance wouldn&#8217;t dictate an assignment to full-season Lakewood, but I bet that&#8217;s where he&#8217;ll land.  Because of his athleticism, the light could go on at any time, and he&#8217;s still pretty young.</p>
<p><b>23. 3B Luis Encarnacion, R/R 6&#8217;2 195, 16</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Unlike many Latin American teenagers that teams sign, Encarnacion actually has a track record of hitting in live games.  His approach is advanced for a hitter so young, another edge he held over many of his competitors in the Dominican Republic.  He makes hard contact to all fields and projects to have plus power which he shouldn&#8217;t have a problem utilizing in games with his hit tool.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Encarnacion is a complete non-athlete.  His chances of staying at third base are poor at best, and his arm isn&#8217;t all that good either.  If he&#8217;s limited to left field, or even just first base, the onus is on his bat to produce value because he&#8217;s not getting it in the field or on the bases.  He hasn&#8217;t taken a professional at-bat yet.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Encarnacion should suit up for the GCL Phillies this year and be one of the youngest players in the league.  Because he&#8217;s so young, whether or not he performs is almost immaterial.</p>
<p><b>22. OF Dylan Cozens, L/L 6&#8217;6 235, 20, Short-season (277 PA, .265/.343/.469, 23.1 K%, 10.1 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> The New York-Penn League is one of the toughest leagues to hit for power in, but Cozens made it look easy.  He has plus-plus raw power because he&#8217;s so strong with a swing made for hitting home runs.  He&#8217;s patient enough to generally wait for his pitch, and his hit tool is a bit better than one would expect from a tall power hitter.  He&#8217;s actually a decent athlete for his size.  He has the strong arm needed for right field.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Despite that surprising athleticism, it&#8217;s not a lock he stays in right field.  Cozens will likely lose speed as he ages which would necessitate a move to first base.  Although his strikeout rate is manageable, he has quite a bit of swing and miss in his game, both because of his long swing and poor pitch recognition.  His ability to make contact will be tested by tougher pitching in the coming years.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Cozens will finally get a taste of full-season ball with Lakewood in 2014.  They&#8217;ve been patient with him, and he should continue to perform now that he&#8217;s spent more time focusing solely on baseball.</p>
<p><b>21. OF Cord Sandberg, L/L 6&#8217;3 215, 19, Rookie (196 PA, .207/.313/.272, 18.4 K%, 12.2 BB%)</b></p>
<p><b>Strengths:</b> Sandberg flashes five average or better tools, led by his potential plus power, thanks to his strength and bat speed.  He&#8217;s a decent athlete who was committed to play quarterback at Mississippi State with an outfield arm that would be expected from a very good QB prospect.  For a player not completely focused on baseball as an amateur, his plate approach was a bit better than expected in his pro debut.</p>
<p><b>Weaknesses:</b> Because of that inexperience, Sandberg has a lot of work to do in all areas of his game.  His pitch recognition and approach need to improve so he can make harder contact more consistently.  His raw power didn&#8217;t show up in games during his debut season.  He&#8217;s athletic, but with his size, he&#8217;s more of a right fielder than center fielder.  He could be a good defender, but he has to get better reads on the ball and take better routes.</p>
<p><b>2014 outlook:</b> Now playing baseball full-time, the Phillies hope Sandberg can unleash his tools on the field at some point.  A number of his problem areas, like the mental aspects of defense, can be corrected with the additional experience he&#8217;ll now be gaining.  He&#8217;ll probably started the season in extended spring training and report to Williamsport in June.</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8904"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8903">CF Aaron Altherr (49 PA, .200 BA, .265 OBP, .267 SLG, 6 R, 3 RBI, 2/3 SB)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8905">Until the end of the season, Altherr played pretty sparingly.  When he did play, he wasn&#8217;t really good.  He did strike out at a bit of a lower rate than he has since he was in short-season ball, but he didn&#8217;t walk much either.  I can&#8217;t imagine this will actually affect the team&#8217;s decision when it comes to adding him to the 40 man roster though.  He got some experience against upper level pitching which will act as a nice preview for 2014 with Reading.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8907"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8906">RHP Ken Giles (10.1 IP, 5.23 ERA, 1.55 WHIP, 16 K, 8 BB)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8908">Two oblique injuries limited Giles&#8217; innings in 2013, so a stint in the AFL helped him recoup some of the lost innings.  In those 10 innings, he was pretty much the same pitcher he has been in his pro career so far: lots of strikeouts but also lots of walks.  He still impressed scouts with his stuff though, throwing several pitches at 100 MPH or better, including the league&#8217;s hardest pitch this season at 101.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8910"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8909">RHP Mike Nesseth (14.2 IP, 9.20 ERA, 1.98 WHIP, 9 K, 8 BB)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8911">Nesseth pitched at three levels in 2013, mostly unsuccessfully.  His 1.64 ERA with Reading looks nice, but his strikeout rate, a key indicator of future success, was low, and he didn&#8217;t have an outstanding walk rate either.  He has to rely on getting ground balls with his sinker since his slider is his only pitch that can generate some swings and misses.  He mixes in a changeup against lefties, but if a reliever needs a third pitch, something is probably wrong with one of the other two.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8913"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8912">OF Cameron Perkins (61 PA, .216/.333/.373, 8 R, 3 RBI)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8914">Perkins was a late addition to the AFL roster when Kelly Dugan was scratched with a toe injury.  It would&#8217;ve been nice to see some power from him, especially in Arizona where the ball carries better, but he continued to live gap to gap with Peoria.  The Phillies probably would&#8217;ve liked to see him get to Reading in his first full season like Cody Asche did in 2012, but a broken wrist slowed his progress.  He boosted his walk rate to a more adequate level and maintained a good strikeout rate.</p>
<p><b>C Cameron Rupp (59 PA, .278/.339/.444, 7 R, 1 HR, 6 RBI)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8915">With a cup of coffee in the majors this year, it would make sense that Rupp would perform better than the other Phillies hitters, but he really didn&#8217;t tear things up either.  He has always struck out too much, and it reached ridiculous heights in the AFL with a 32.2% rate.  Otherwise, he continued playing the way he normally does, walking enough and hitting for above average power for a catcher.  The extra reps for him this fall will help him going into spring training next year as he&#8217;ll compete to make the Opening Day roster.</p>
<p><b>RHP Kyle Simon (14.1 IP, 3.14 ERA, 1.26 WHIP, 11 K, 6 BB)</b></p>
<p>Simon missed a couple weeks this year with an elbow injury, but he didn&#8217;t miss that many innings.  He was completely ineffective though, and the Phillies probably want to see if he can get on track to join their bullpen in 2014.  Comparing Pitch F/X data from this year&#8217;s stint in Arizona to last year&#8217;s, it looks like the elbow injury could still be affecting him.  His velocity was down a little bit, and his fastball didn&#8217;t have quite as much movement.  In limited innings with Peoria, he got his strikeout rate back near its 2012 levels after the Phillies acquired him, but he needs to throw more strikes.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8917"><b id="yui_3_13_0_1_1384823413528_8916">LHP Austin Wright (10.2 IP, 5.91 ERA, 2.06 WHIP, 11 K, 6 BB)</b></p>
<p>Wright had a disastrous 2013 season with Reading, walking 13.5% of opponents.  He improved on that a little with Peoria, but 11.1% is still pretty poor.  When he actually was working in the zone, his 92 MPH fastball was getting hammered to the tune of a .333 average and .667 SLG.  Maybe an off-season off will help him clear his head and get ready for 2014, but i the problem is mechanical, it&#8217;s going to take a lot more than some time off.  He uses a slider against lefties and righties and a changeup against righties.</p>

<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12020">Over the past month, Baseball America has been rolling out their top 20 prospect by minor league lists.  Their top 10 and 30 lists by organization always get more attention, but in a way, the top 20 lists are more informative.  When you&#8217;re comparing Jesse Biddle to Maikel Franco, you can decide one is better than the other, but maybe neither is very good.  When you compare Biddle to some Twins or Red Sox prospects in the Eastern League, you can get a sense of how he&#8217;s viewed against a deeper and more talented pool of players.  Across six affiliates, nine Phillies were named top 20 prospects in their respective league, including Maikel Franco in two.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12023"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12022">CF Aaron Altherr (20th in Florida State League)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12027">After repeating the South Atlantic League, Altherr had his best season as a professional with Clearwater in the FSL.  For most of his career, he struggled making contact, but not only did he bat much better in 2013, he tapped into his power potential too, hitting 12 home runs and leading the league in doubles with 36.  He still has speed too, stealing 20+ bases for the third straight year and having a better than even shot at staying in center field.  He has two major areas to improve: his energy level and plate approach.  BA&#8217;s report indicates there are scouts that believe his effort is lacking at times, and he has to cut down on his swings and misses.  He has some chances to do that in the Arizona Fall League this off-season.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12029"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12028">3B Cody Asche (ninth in International League)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12030">There are years that a Triple-A top prospect list is severely lacking in talent, but 2013&#8242;s was a bit deeper than usual.  The top four, Red Sox SS Xander Bogaerts, Rays OF Wil Myers, Pirates RHP Gerrit Cole and Rays RHP Chris Archer, have appeared in postseason play.  At ninth, Asche was actually ahead of five players that were in BA&#8217;s preseason top 100, and if he didn&#8217;t exhaust his prospect eligibility, it&#8217;s possible he would&#8217;ve been there in 2014.  With a feel for contact, decent defense and athleticism and high energy, he could be an average major leaguer.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12032"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12031">LHP Jesse Biddle (11th in Eastern League)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12033">11th may seem a bit low, but considering his command problems and the talent in the league, it&#8217;s a fair spot.  He&#8217;ll still be ranked in the top 100 but will probably be appearing behind Maikel Franco in rankings for the 2014 season.  His fastball and curveball give him two good pitches, and his changeup should be adequate if he can start throwing more strikes.  The Phillies are probably hoping that his second half struggles can be partially attribtued to his whooping cough and foot injury that dogged him most of the season.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12035"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12034">RF/1B Dylan Cozens (9th in New York Penn League)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12036">The selection of Cozens in the second round two years ago was pretty puzzling, but it seems like the Phillies may have been onto something.  The NYPL is awful for hitters, but he was able to hit nine home runs in 68 games, finishing in the top five in the league in homers and slugging (.469).  He was able to bat .265, but with a dead pull approach at the plate, he&#8217;ll have to make adjustments as he gets older.  It&#8217;s a positive sign that his massive raw power is already resulting in actual production.  Even if he has to move to first base because he&#8217;s so big, he should have the power to profile there.  For a player not even ranked in BA&#8217;s top 500 going into the 2012 draft, he&#8217;s two spots ahead of Mets first rounder Garin Cecchini on this list.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12038"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12037">SS J.P. Crawford (sixth in Gulf Coast League)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12039">Defensively, Crawford came as advertised after the Phillies drafted him 16th overall.  What places him among the elite talent in the GCL was his surprising ability at the plate.  Before being promoted to Lakewood to finish the season, he led the league in batting average and on-base percentage and even showed some gap power.  With as many walks as strikeouts, his plate approach was more advanced than expected too.  Lately, the Phillies have been holding high school hitters back in extended spring training to start their first full seasons, but Crawford clearly does not need that that extra seasoning.</p>
<p><b>3B Maikel Franco (fourth in EL, fifth in FSL)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12040">While a couple late season reports picked apart some of the negative aspects of Franco&#8217;s game, BA received a number of great reports, some that even placed him just behind future Twins star slugger Miguel Sano.  His defense should be adequate enough to stay at third base as long as the Phillies allow it.  Surrounded by names like Pittsburgh&#8217;s Gregory Polanco and the Mets&#8217; Noah Syndergaard, Franco could even be pushing top 25 territory this offseason.  He could be the big right-handed bat they&#8217;ve been desperate for.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12049"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12048">3B Zach Green (fourth in NYPL)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12041">Green&#8217;s power is just as good as Cozens&#8217;, and he offers some other useful skills too.  His 13 home runs led the league, was tied for the league lead in doubles with 20 and won the league&#8217;s home run derby.  He strikes out so much it&#8217;s almost as if he&#8217;s doing it intentionally, but he walks a lot too which would indicate he&#8217;s not a completely wild hacker.  If he can improve his pitch recognition as he gets older, he&#8217;ll be an even more effective hitter.  He can run the bases a little and has the potential to be a good defensive third baseman.  His makeup should allow him to make the most of his ability.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12047"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12046">1B Darin Ruf (17th in IL)</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12042">Ruf is still a limited player, but this is where the league&#8217;s list drops off anyway.  His minor league stats weren&#8217;t as good this year because pitchers were more careful with him, but he&#8217;s still able to hit any fastball, especially when they&#8217;re over the inner half.  He had reverse splits in the majors this year, but that probably won&#8217;t last.  If Ryne Sandberg feels comfortable with his job security, he could have Ruf platoon with Ryan Howard and also get some action in left field with a defensive replacement ready to go.</p>
<p id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12044"><b id="yui_3_13_0_rc_1_1_1382660884463_12043">CF Carlos Tocci (18th in South Atlantic League)</b></p>
<p>Despite having the second lowest OPS among qualifiers in the SAL, Tocci&#8217;s prospect stock is mostly unchanged.  That&#8217;s positive to hear, because it&#8217;s almost impossible to find something positive about his statistics.  He didn&#8217;t walk or steal bases efficiently, or even above 50%.  An opposing manager commented that he just needs to get stronger which makes sense for an 18 year old that weighs just 160 pounds.  If getting stronger can correct his problems, maybe we&#8217;ll see that improvement as soon as next season.  For now, it&#8217;s probably best to pretend 2013 never happened.</p>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4543"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4542">Pitching staff</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4544">It didn&#8217;t take long for the Phillies to go from &#8220;four aces&#8221; to a rotation that was really pretty bad behind the top two starters.  With the money they were prepared to spend on Miguel Alfredo Gonzalez, they&#8217;re certainly counting on him to provide quality depth behind Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee.  He&#8217;s still a complete wild card at this point, but I would imagine he&#8217;s essentially guaranteed a spot going into next season.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4545">Of their top two domestic pitching prospects, Jesse Biddle and Adam Morgan, I would expect Morgan to get the first call if necessary, although neither player really finished their season on a high note.  With Morgan&#8217;s shoulder pain flaring up again right at the end of the season, he&#8217;s going to have to prove he&#8217;s the same prospect he was back in 2012.  Biddle&#8217;s control problems show that he&#8217;s not yet ready for the majors and could use a few months in Triple-A to see if he can find the strike zone more.  Morgan has the experience edge, so I think he&#8217;d be their first choice if both are healthy and pitching well.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4546">The Phillies&#8217; bullpen once again had a lot of problems at the end of games, but the relief well is suddenly dry.  Pitchers like Phillippe Aumont, Jake Diekman, Justin De Fratus and Ethan Martin no longer have prospect status, and it&#8217;s up to them to develop and improve in the majors now.  It&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;re going to be supplemented by internal relief options next season barring a surprise performance.  The injuries and struggles from Kyle Simon and Ken Giles in 2013 may take them off the radar for next year, and they were the two relievers that had the most potential for an impact.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4547">One potential left-handed option that got a few innings with the Phillies at the end of the year is Mauricio Robles.  He was once a very good prospect for Seattle, and now that he&#8217;s healthy, he had a pretty effective season in the minors.  With the volatile nature of relievers, he could go right back to struggling next year, but he earned a chance to complete for a spot in spring training next year.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4548"><b>Bats</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4549">In 2009, the Phillies scored 820 runs, good for fourth in the league.  They&#8217;ve scored fewer runs every year since, culminating in their 610 run season this year.  Baseball as a whole has been scoring fewer runs, but it&#8217;s clear their offense is not where it needs to be for them to be a playoff team again.  Unfortunately, anyone that could contribute in 2014 is very likely to be blocked by a player already in the majors, namely Maikel Franco.  As hard as he may try, I can&#8217;t imagine Ruben Amaro will be able to move Ryan Howard, so first base isn&#8217;t an option.  When Cody Asche was called up, the Phillies suggested they&#8217;d be willing to try him out in the outfield to increase his versatility, but he didn&#8217;t play an inning in the outfield.  They could still move him off third base in the future, but I&#8217;d expect to see him at the hot corner again in 2014.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1380680630914_4550">Domonic Brown will be occupying one corner outfield spot, and the other could be open.  He won&#8217;t be ready to start the season, but Kelly Dugan could be an option as the year wears on.  He was okay after his promotion to Double-A, and he&#8217;ll get more time to face upper level pitching in the Arizona Fall League.  If he gets off to a good start in 2014 and an opportunity opens up, he could get a chance like Asche did this season.</p>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6470"> <b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6469">No big deal</b></p>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6474"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6473">2B Cesar Hernandez (wrist):</b> Wrist injuries can be very troubling (keep this in mind later,) but even though Hernandez&#8217;s didn&#8217;t heal as quickly as expected missing a month of the season, he seems to be doing fine.  It was reported that it troubled him more batting right-handed, already his weaker side of the plate.  He&#8217;s been hitting well since his return, and the Phillies will have a decision to make with a player out of options next season.</p>

<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6480"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6479">RHP Kyle Simon (elbow):</b> Simon missed a couple weeks with elbow soreness, and like I do with Wright momentarily, only put it here since elbow problems are never good for pitchers.  What&#8217;s troubling is that minor elbow soreness doesn&#8217;t really explain why he was so bad this year.  His strikeout and walk rates declined to where they were when he was an Orioles starter, not nearly as effective as he was after the trade last year.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6482"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6481">LHP Austin Wright (elbow):</b> Wright missed about a month with elbow tendinitis.  When he came back, his first four starts were as bad as any four starts could be, getting tuned up for 20 runs in 14.1 innings and a 1.166 OPS against.  He got it together to a point after that, but not enough to restore his stock.  He was moved to the bullpen at the end of the year and wasn&#8217;t able to improve his results.  He&#8217;s going to the AFL along with Simon, Giles and Dugan, but I wonder if just resting his elbow the whole off-season would be a better course of action.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6483"><b>Problematic</b></p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6485"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6484">RHP Miguel Gonzalez (elbow):</b> Obviously a player they Phillies signed three weeks ago wasn&#8217;t on my pre-season top 30 list, but he&#8217;s now a key figure in the organization.  His rumored elbow problems were serious enough for him to lose $32 million and still end up with the Phillies.  His injury must be an ongoing issue because it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to me for him to not pitch until spring training.  As far as I can tell, he hasn&#8217;t even thrown 10 competitive innings over the last two calendar years, and I find it hard to believe a player can go that long without real game action and then just turn it on in spring training.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6487"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6486">1B Tommy Joseph (concussion):</b> I&#8217;m not sure if injuries affected any prospect more than Joseph this season, not just in the organization, but all of baseball.  A concussion and the nasty symptoms that can follow are going to force him out from behind the plate.  This can affect him the rest of his life, and as for baseball, it significantly affects his value.  This season was pretty much lost for him, and he doesn&#8217;t have the bat to profile as a first baseman.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6489"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6488">LHP Adam Morgan (shoulder):</b> The Phillies have used 10 different starters this season, and if Morgan hadn&#8217;t missed so much time, I would imagine he&#8217;d be one of the 10.  He was limited to 78.1 innings this year because of a partially torn rotator cuff early in the year, and it flared up again in his final start a couple weeks ago.  They&#8217;re still sticking with the belief that he just needs rest to get back to the level he used to be at, but shoulder injuries lingering for pitchers tends to be bad news.</p>
<p id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6491"><b id="yui_3_7_2_1_1379724928059_6490">SS Roman Quinn (wrist):</b> While Hernandez was able to rebound from his wrist soreness, Quinn&#8217;s broken wrist suffered halfway through the season could have an impact.  He missed the last two months of the season when he was finally starting to heat up, and wrist injuries can be career changers for batters.  It could take some extra patience for Quinn as he returns to action in 2014.</p>
<p><b>RHP Shane Watson (shoulder):</b> Watson&#8217;s first full pro season was pretty short due to shoulder inflammation that limited him to 72 innings with Lakewood.  He wasn&#8217;t very good for most of the year, but he was starting to adjust before going down with the injury.  Previous comments from Ruben Amaro would indicate that he&#8217;s expecting Watson&#8217;s diabetes to complicate injury recovery during his career, but hopefully that&#8217;s not the case.  It would be big for him to get up to 120-130 innings with Clearwater in 2014.</p>
